INTRODUCTION
- that clearly describes the topic, the topic background, who is affected or what the significance or application(s) of the topic is/are etc. 
- Introductions are 100% non-technical and should contain images that help the reader to understand the topic.
- A "paragraph" is 7 - 10 complete sentences. Grades for this portion will be based on clarity, flow, 100% non-technical content, useful/illustrative images, and graduate-level writing.
- If using a website, you must have a TAB that is called Introduction. 

- A topic/area is not the same as a model or method. For example, topics (areas) include climate change, political issues, language or image translation, stock valuation, etc.
- A model or method is what you use to make your predictions - such as neural networks (ANN, CNN, RNN, RNN/LSTM, etc.). 
- When you create your introduction, it is ONLY about the topic and not about the models or methods.
